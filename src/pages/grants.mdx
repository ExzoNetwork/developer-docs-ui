## Investments

Investment size could be up to $100,000 per project. The general investment program is designed to fund projects covering a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to:

1. Digital identity and privacy
2. Scalability solutions
3. DeFi-related and DEX-related products
4. NFT-related solutions
5. Games:

- Educational - games that ease entrance for those not familiar with blockchain technology or background
- Innovative games uniting blockchain and cryptocurrencies with AI, VR/AR and other high-tech domains. We will support teams and developers who are more experienced in high-tech domains with their development on blockchain.
- Crypto gamification
- Other games (strategies, collectibles, card games, etc)

1. dApps that unite the Exzo Network blockchain with traditional sectors - Banking, Healthcare, Manufacturing, etc. We support teams from different domains who use blockchain to solve real business problems
2. Adoption of dApps - solutions that aid the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain on a wide scale.

We also will actively encourage developers on creating solutions that increase decentralization and transparency of the Exzo Network Ecosystem - possibly additional funding via ecosystem fund.

All projects will be tracked on GitHub. Teams can apply for grants more than once, but they need to successfully complete the previous project before receiving additional funds.

Projects that were chosen for the grant may also receive additional $10,000 funding from AWS per project. {{className: 'italic'}}

Below are the step-by-step processes for participation (and receipt) of the Exzo Network Grant to projects and developers building on the Exzo Network blockchain.

For further assistance on the Exzo Network Grant or the steps below, please directly message Exzo Network COO

## Exzo Network GRANT STEPS:

### 1. Project Proposal

- The target project or product team approaches Exzo Network through official communication channels, defining the tool/task to be developed upon the Exzo Network blockchain.
- The Exzo Network Chief Technical Officer alongside the Exzo Network developer team can brainstorm further or through specifics if something can be added for mutually beneficial development within the stipulated development proposal.
- The proposal will be clearly thought-through and be in a stage of â€˜ready developmentâ€™, meaning the target team are able to bring development from the moment of confirmation of Exzo Network Grant cooperation.

### 2. Timeline, Development Team, and Funding Requirements

- The target project or product team will approach the Exzo Network Grants team defining the approximate time needed for the development of the aforementioned product or service upon the Exzo Network Blockchain, the people/ developers/ key workers who will be directly involved in the development of the product or service, and the explicit financial breakdowns and necessities asked of the Exzo Network Grant team needed for the development.
- The Exzo Network Grant is strictly allocated for development works and developer costs to deliver on the aforementioned product or service on the Exzo Network Blockchain, and not â€˜other expendituresâ€™, such as marketing or influencer outreach. This is strictly a development grant provided by Exzo Network.

### 3. Formalized Agreement, Contract, Agreed Grant Total and Terms and Conditions

- At this stage, a formalized, legally binding agreement is provided from the Exzo Network Grant team to the project/ product team, defining:

  The total, summarized grant amount

  The release structure of the grant amount

  General terms and conditions, legal disclaimers, and miscellaneous technicalities.

- Both parties will sign the agreement before development begins and grant values are disbursed.

### 4. Milestones Reached and Open Source Code Audit

- Once the grant-receiving project has finalized development of the agreed project, product or service, or reached a major pre-agreed milestone of development, the development code must be made open-source and undergo auditing stages on behalf of the Exzo Network Development team to verify its legitimacy.
- Audits are mandatory, and as such, the open-source nature of the development must also be made mandatory at the point of product/ service completion or milestone reached, per the signed agreement.

### 5. Exzo Network Grant Released

- Providing the steps above are completed and achieved at a satisfactory level, the agreed Exzo Network Grant will be released to the project team. This will be in accordance with the signed agreement, where all totals, breakdowns of disbursement protocols and more are detailed explicitly.
